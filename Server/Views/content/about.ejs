        I'm beyond excited to be writing this "about me" post.  
      </p>
      <p>I could't have
        imagined that my first "Hello World" would lead me into such a
        deep and exciting world of possibilty.  From eCommerce to game development, I want to try it all.</p>
      <p>Please, feel free to take a look around at some of the things I've built.  <a target="_blank" href="http://studentweb.cencol.ca/kfowler9/COMP125_ken_assignment5/assignment5.html">Monster Hunter</a> is an incredibly simple browser game that I made in Centennial College's COMP125 course.
         I also have a <a href="#">business webpage</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01070c543d5e24cdd0?viewMode=1">Upwork profile</a> where I'm experimenting with freelance web development</p>
